# aichat Terminator Agent

An AI agent that translates natural language into shell commands with built-in safety mechanisms. Every command requires user confirmation before execution.

## Features

- Natural language to shell command translation
- Human-in-the-loop safety: all commands require approval
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Session mode for extended workflows

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Required tools:
- [aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat) - The core LLM CLI tool
- [argc](https://github.com/sigoden/argc) - Command parser
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) - JSON processor

**Installation options:**
- **macOS/Linux**: Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install all dependencies
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: Use `apt` for jq, install argc and aichat manually
- **Other platforms**: Follow individual project installation guides

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aichat-terminator-agent.git
cd aichat-terminator-agent
./setup.sh
```

Verify installation:
```bash
aichat --list-agents  # Should show 'terminator'
```

## Usage

### Basic usage:
```bash
aichat --agent terminator "list all files"
aichat --agent terminator "show git status"
aichat --agent terminator "check disk usage"
```
### Interactive session:

Enter REPL mode:
```bash
aichat --agent terminator --session
```

Then chat in session:
```bash
terminator>temp) create a test.txt file                                                                                                                                                 0
I will create a file named "test.txt" in the current directory. This file will be empty initially. The command I'll use is `touch test.txt`, which safely creates an empty file if it does not exist, or updates the timestamp if it does.

Executing the command now.
Call terminator execute_command {"command":"touch test.txt"}
Execute command: touch test.txt [Y/n] y

terminator>temp) delete test file                                                                                                                                                 518(0%)
I will delete the "test.txt" file from the current directory. This command will remove the file permanently from the system.

The command I'll use is `rm test.txt`.

Executing the command now.
Call terminator execute_command {"command":"rm test.txt"}
Execute command: rm test.txt [Y/n] y
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

**IMPORTANT: This tool executes shell commands based on AI interpretation.**

- **Always review commands before confirming** - The AI may misunderstand your request
- **Never run as root/administrator** - Use regular user privileges only  
- **Test in safe environments first** - Don't use on production systems initially
- **Commands execute with your permissions** - They can modify/delete files you have access to

**Type 'n' to cancel any command you're unsure about.**

## Troubleshooting

Manual setup:
```bash
./Argcfile.sh check     # Verify dependencies
./Argcfile.sh reinstall # Clean reinstall
```
